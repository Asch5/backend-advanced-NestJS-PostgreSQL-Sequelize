This is a backend REST API application built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework. The tech stack includes:

- NestJS - Modular and scalable backend framework for Node.js
- TypeScript - Provides static typing and object-oriented features
- PostgreSQL - Relational database for data storage and querying
- Sequelize - ORM for interacting with the database
- Swagger - Auto-generate API documentation
- 
Key features:

- Role-based access control (RBAC) - Manage user roles and permissions
- Authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- Validation using class-validator pipes
- File upload and storage capabilities
- Database migration and seeding
- Unit and e2e testing with Jest

Backend

- The backend is built on NestJS, which provides dependency injection, modular organization and decorator-based functionality out of the box.
- App structure follows layered architecture - controllers, services, repositories. This promotes separation of concerns and encapsulation.
- Controllers handle incoming API requests and return responses. They delegate business logic to services.
- Services contain the core application logic and call repository methods.
- Repositories manage interactions with the database through Sequelize ORM.
- Reusable features like authentication are extracted into modules that can be imported.
- ConfigService manages environment-specific configuration.
- 
Database

- PostgreSQL database with Sequelize for schema definition and querying.
- Database migration handled by Sequelize CLI for tracking schema changes.
- Seeder functionality seeds sample data into tables.
- Models define table schemas with decorator validation for strong typing.
- Associations defined between models to construct relations.

Security

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) used for stateless user authentication.
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt before storing for encryption.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) limits user permissions based on roles.
- Route guards protect endpoints and limit access.

Validation

- Class-validator for automatic DTO validation using decorators.
- Custom pipes transform and validate input data.
- Custom exceptions created for consistent error handling.

Testing

- Jest for unit and integration testing of services and repositories.
- Supertest for HTTP testing of API endpoints.
- Test coverage reports generated.

Documentation

- OpenAPI specs auto-generated using Swagger.
- Hosted on route for API documentation.
- Annotated DTOs used for input/output models.

The modular architecture makes the app easily extensible. RBAC and validation enforce security and data integrity. Overall, NestJS provides an enterprise-ready and scalable backend for production use cases.

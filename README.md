This is a backend REST API application built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework. The tech stack includes:

- NestJS - Modular and scalable backend framework for Node.js
- TypeScript - Provides static typing and object-oriented features
- PostgreSQL - Relational database for data storage and querying
- Sequelize - ORM for interacting with the database
- Swagger - Auto-generate API documentation
- 
Key features:

- Role-based access control (RBAC) - Manage user roles and permissions
- Authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- Validation using class-validator pipes
- File upload and storage capabilities
- Database migration and seeding
- Unit and e2e testing with Jest

The core business logic resides in the service layer and controllers handle API routes and requests. Reusable functionality like authentication is extracted into modules and can be imported.

The PostgreSQL database handles data persistence with the help of Sequelize for table relationships and querying. Migrations allow tracking schema changes.

Validation pipes leverage class-validator for request data validation. Custom exceptions handle validation errors.

Swagger documentation is auto-generated from controller annotations for the API schema.

Testing is done with Jest for unit and integration tests. Supertest enables endpoint testing.

The modular architecture makes the app easily extensible. RBAC and validation enforce security and data integrity. Overall, NestJS provides an enterprise-ready and scalable backend for production use cases.
